# About the Project
This project was created for the UTSA Data Analytics Bootcamp (module 23: final project).  Our assignment was to: 
* Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. 
* Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies weâ€™ve learned. 
* Use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library. 
* It had to be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

# Project Report: Housing Trends and Predictions in Major Texas Cities

## Purpose and Scope
The goal of our project was to analyze and identify trends in historical home values and use this data to predict future home values. We examined home values in 5 major cities in Texas, including Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio. 

## Data Source
Our data is in the form of csv files from Zillow housing data site: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. Specifically, we analyzed the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) data, which is measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. We built a machine learning prediction model using this historical data and were able to compare it to the Zillow Home Value Forecast (ZHVF), which is a  month-ahead, quarter-ahead and year-ahead forecast of the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI). 

## Analyzing the Data
We analyzed historical data using Tableau. We identified the growth across each year from 2018 to 2023 (using January data points). We also visualized home values across all available zip codes in Texas through heat maps with user driven filters by city. 

## Building the Maching Learning Model
We built a machine learning model in Jupyter Notebook using sci-kit learn. 

### Data Preprocessing:
The data was read into the script from the csv and preprocessed using the following steps: 
*

### Compiling, Training, and Optimizing the Model:
